Moving into 2021, these trends remain clear - Organizations want Data Science, Cloud, and Apps. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening and how Docker plays a part in the essential skills of 2020-2021 and beyond.  Articles in Series     Part 1 - Five Full-Stack Data Science Technologies   Part 2 - AWS Cloud    Part 3 - Docker (You Are Here)   Part 4 - Git Version Control   Part 5 - H2O Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)   Part 6 - R Shiny vs Tableau (3 Business Application Examples)    - The Shiny Production with AWS Book   Changing Trends in Tech Jobs  Indeed, the popular employment-related search engine, released an article this past Tuesday showing changing trends from 2015 to 2019 in \u201cTechnology-Related Job Postings\u201d. We can see a number of changes in key technologies - One that we are particularly interested in is the 4000% increase in Docker.     Source: Indeed Hiring Lab.   Drivers of Change  There are 3 Key Drivers of changes in technologies:          Rise of Machine Learning (and more generically Data Science) - Unlock Business Insights           Businesses Shifting to the Cloud Services versus On-Premise Infrastructure - Massive Cost Savings and Flexibility Increase           Businesses Shifting to Distributed Applications versus Ad-Hoc Executive Reports - Democratize Data and Improve Decision-Making within the Organization      If you aren\u2019t gaining experience in data science, cloud, and web applications, you are risking your future.  Machine Learning (Point 1)  Data Science is shifting. We already know the importance of Machine Learning. But a NEW CHANGE is happening. Organizations need distributed data science. This requires a new set of skills - Docker, Git, and Apps. (More on this in a minute).  Cloud Services (Point 2)  Last week, I released \u201cData Science with AWS\u201d. In the article, I spoke about the shift to Cloud Services and the need to learn AWS (No. 6 on Indeed\u2019s Skill Table, 418% Growth). I\u2019ll reiterate - AWS is my Number 1 skill that you must learn going into 2020.  Azure (No. 17, 1107% Growth) is in the same boat along with Google Cloud Platform for Data Scientists in Digital Marketing.  The nice thing about cloud - If you learn one, then you can quickly switch to the others.  Distributed Web Applications (Point 3) Businesses now need Apps + Cloud. I discuss this at length in this YouTube video.           Watch on YouTube      &nbsp;&nbsp;     Download the Slides     Let\u2019s talk about the BIG CHANGE from the video\u2026  The Big Change: From 2015 to 2020, apps now essential to business strategy  The landscape of Data Science is changing from reporting to application building:     In 2015 - Businesses need reports to make better decisions   In 2020 - Businesses need apps to empower better decision making at all levels of the organization   This transition is challenging the Data Scientist to learn new technologies to stay relevant\u2026  In fact, it\u2019s no longer sufficient to just know machine learning. We also need to know how to put machine learning into production as quickly as possible to meet the business needs.  To do so, we need to learn from the Programmers the basics of Software Engineering that can help in our quest to unleash data science at scale and unlock business value.  Learning from programmers  Programmers need applications to run no matter where they are deployed, which is the definition of reproducibility.  The programming community has developed amazing tools that help solve this issue of reproducibility for software applications:          Docker (and DockerHub) - Controls the software environment state           Git (and GitHub) - Controls the file state      It turns out that Data Scientists can use these tools to build apps that work.  We\u2019ll focus on Docker (and DockerHub), and we\u2019ll make a separate article for Git (and GitHub).  What is Docker?  Let\u2019s look at a (Shiny) application to see what Docker does and how it helps.    We can see that application consists of 2 things:          Files - The set of instructions for the app. For a Shiny App this includes an app.R file that contains layout instructions, server control instructions, database instructions, etc           Software - The code external to your files that your application files depend on. For a Shiny App, this is R, Shiny Server, and any libraries your app uses.      Docker \"locks down\" the Software Environment. This means your software is 100% controlled so that your application uses the same software every time.  Key terminology  Dockerfile  A Dockerfile contains the set of instructions to create a Docker Container. Here\u2019s an example from my Shiny Developer with AWS Course.    Dockerfile - Used to create a Docker Container From Shiny Developer with AWS Course  Docker Container  A docker container is a stored version of the software environment built - Think of this as a saved state that can be reproduced on any server (or computer).  Docker Containers are a productivity booster. It usually takes 30 minutes or so to build a software environment in Docker, but once built the container can be stored locally or on DockerHub. The Docker Container can then be installed in minutes on a server or computer.  Without Docker Containers, it would take 30 minutes per server/computer to build an equivalent environment.  Key Point: Docker Containers not only save the state of the software environment making apps reproducible, but they also enhance productivity for data scientists trying to meet the ever-changing business needs.  DockerHub  DockerHub is a repository for Docker Containers that have been previously built.  You can install these containers on computers or use these Containers as the base for new containers.    DockerHub - Used to share Docker Containers From Shiny Developer with AWS Course  Real Docker Use Case Example  In Shiny Developer with AWS, we use the following application architecture that uses AWS EC2 to create an Ubuntu Linux Server that hosts a Shiny App in the cloud called the Stock Analyzer.    Data Science Web Application Architecture From Shiny Developer with AWS Course  We use a Dockerfile that is based on rocker/shiny-verse:latest version.  We build on top of the \u201cshiny-verse\u201d container to increase the functionality by adding libraries:     mongolite for connecting to NoSQL databases   shiny libraries like shinyjs, shinywidgets to increase shiny functionality   shinyauthr for authentication         We then deploy our \u201cStock Analyzer\u201d application using this Docker Container called shinyauth. The application gets hosted on our Amazon AWS EC2 instance.      If you are ready to learn how to build and deploy Shiny Applications in the cloud using AWS, then I recommend my NEW 4-Course R-Track System, which includes:     Business Analysis with R (Beginner)   Data Science for Business (Advanced)   Shiny Web Applications (Intermediate)   Expert Shiny Developer with AWS (Advanced) - NEW COURSE!!         I look forward to providing you the best data science for business education.

At least not for Arya Diwase and Anushka Desai.The friends realised that education was one of the hardest-hit industries during the lockdown and that it was a time when mentorship was most required. Cashing in on this opportunity, the duo launched student mentorship Application Ally in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.Arya and Anushka who had met through Arya\u2019s not for profit organisation Jazz Hands had personal experience, applying for universities abroad previously and understood the challenges faced by students in this regard. Also, the pandemic is not particularly an easy time for students applying abroad, with a number of things to take into consideration while choosing universities.Arya, who has been working as an AIF Clinton Fellow, a competitive fellowship for social entrepreneurs, had applied to various top programs and secured admission to competitive universities like Harvard, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Duke, Berkeley, Northwestern, USC, NYU and several more since 2014.On the other hand, Anushka pursued a master\u2019s in Understanding Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse at Goldsmiths, University of London.Their own experiences in the application process led them to realise some invaluable insights develop a unique method to help fellow aspirants.\u201cI realised there is a lot of false information in the process available right now in the consultancy space. And people we have worked with also started asking for advice as they felt a slight disconnect with the existing consultancies,\u201d says Arya.The founders claim that there is a fundamental lack of integrity, personalisation, and ethics in the country's current education consulting system.\u00a0A significant reason behind this, they believe, is that consultants aren't students or have no experience of studying or living abroad.\u201cWith consolidated admits to\u00a0over 18 different international universities including\u00a0four Ivy League institutions, winning over three crores in scholarships and being acknowledged to three competitive professional fellowships, we capitalised on our diverse academic profiles\u00a0to assist guide a plethora of students with varied interests,\u201d adds Anushka.Starting upArya and Anushka had to research extensively to develop a business model. It took over two years for them in identifying a need that exists in the market and in creating a product that doesn't already exist.Once they had the business strategy in place, they personally made over 100 initial outreach calls to prospective clients, designed the website, and developed a social network marketing strategy to launch the business.Arya says the startup was launched to provide individualised assistance with the overseas college admission process. It aims to solve the problem of lack of availability of affordable quality education consulting services, while keeping integrity at the core of its work.\u00a0\u201cHowever, the application season this year is extremely competitive due to deferrals during COVID-19 and a higher number of people applying to college during a recession. Navigating that has been challenging. Additionally, colleges have updated a lot of their application requirements such as standardised testing requirements, essay prompts, etc.\u201d Anushka explains.Thus, the major task for the startup was to be more aware and stay\u00a0up-to-date on these changes for its clients.Personalised approachApplication Ally believes applications are not just about the administrative elements and requires a lot of personalisation as not everyone has the same academic or career trajectory. Thus, the startup\u2019s goal is not only to secure its clients an admission but to also help them attain a college that matches their potential, passion, and goals.For this, the founders spend time with clients, understanding their client\u2019s past journeys, requirements, financial constraints etc - based on which Application Ally allows applicants to access a pool of resources. It is primarily aimed at students looking to apply for undergraduate and graduate programs.Providing tailored assistance and verified guidance, along with school resource optimisation, Application Ally also provides counselling to individuals for extracurricular engagement support, alumni network, and interview preps, along with a series of workshops to support self-learning.\u201cApplication Ally does not believe in agency ties. We are not affiliated with colleges or third-party agencies. We believe that with college tie-ups, consultants often push clients towards colleges that may not be the right fit for them. Each client has a unique profile and requires college lists that best fit their financial, program, country and cultural requirements,\u201d says Arya.Taste of successNot having had a standard academic or professional business background, in the beginning, Anushka and Arya continually undermined their potential as entrepreneurs. They re-thought each choice of theirs and every objective set was smaller than it should have been.However, they surpassed their annual profit goal set for 2020-2021 by 300 percent within a month of launching operations.The startup\u2019s customer base comprise 60 percent of graduate students and 40 percent undergraduates. It claims to have secured over 50+ clients. Despite launching during the lockdown, the team claims to have had a 57.81 percent net profit margin over six months.Going ahead, the goal for the startup is to make the college application process more honest and student-centric rather than consultant-centric.

She hoarded anything that came from India like sweets, pickles, and ethnic clothes with care.\u00a0\u00a0For most non-resident Indians abroad, the cheapest way to get access to traditional products would be getting their friends and family back home send over the things they needed. However, Chetana believes asking for favours even from family members sometimes became a little too much. Her parents were also elderly and ailing and would find it difficult to go through the process.\u201cI really needed Indian products like pickles and I started aching for them after a while. As I started my own family later, there were things in my childhood that I thought my daughter was missing out on. It came to a point that I was embarrassed to ask for favours anymore,\u201d she says.During festivals like Diwali and Dussehra, Chetana couldn\u2019t dress up her daughter the way she wanted because ethnic clothes like lehengas would cost nearly five times the price in the UK and she was not very happy with the options available.\u00a0After returning to India in 2017, Chetana wanted to solve this problem for NRIs by starting an international package forwarding service. Registered in 2018, Forward Parcel was officially launched in 2019, a year after setting up the warehouse and website.\u00a0Chetana and her husband Rajesh Gavini who joined as a co-founder were aware of the market need as most of their Indian friends and colleagues abroad continued to face similar challenges.\u00a0How it works\u00a0After regstering on Forward Parcel\u2019s website, customers will be provided an Indian address and a phone number, which they can use to start shopping domestically.\u00a0The startup receives packages on their behalf while customers can track the status via an online dashboard. It will also send notifications with approximate weight and store all their products till the customer is done purchasing online.\u00a0\u00a0Forward Parcel then consolidates all the items in one box \u2013 remove and add packaging where needed \u2013 and delivers to their doorstep anywhere in the world within five working days.Chetana says customers save at least 70 percent on shipping by shopping through their platform instead of buying and internationally shipping products individually from each marketplace.\u00a0Once the customs paperwork is done, customers receive the final weight and shipping price, and the tracking information. Approximately, it would cost around Rs 6,000 for a package weighing 10 kg.\u00a0Challenges in the journeyAn engineering graduate from G Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Science for Women in Hyderabad, Chetana moved to the UK in 2005 to pursue a master's in multimedia communications engineering from De Montfort University in Leicester.\u00a0While Chetana is an experienced digital marketer, Rajesh brings his expertise in warehousing and operations, which has helped in managing their business. He earlier worked with Nestle in the UK and then Amazon in India.\u00a0Chetana began by reaching out to online Indian groups like \u2018Indians in London\u2019 and similar pages on social media in various countries. From there, most of the businesses are driven by word-of-mouth and references.\u00a0Many have appreciated the service once they understood the multi-step process. With more than 6,000 registered customers, Chetana claims to have 85 percent repeat customers.\u00a0The platform is also drawing interest from non-Indian population abroad with over 1,000 foreign customers registered for their service.\u00a0However, the duo says navigating their workspace and market in India was a challenge as Chetana had never worked in India before. She says being selected to the second cohort of WE HUB incubation programme has helped with access to mentorship, customer resources management, and connecting with investors who have shown interest in infusing funds.\u00a0In addition to the surge in demand amid the pandemic, the Hyderabad-based startup saw its highest sales during Diwali last month.
