Moving into 2021, these trends remain clear - Organizations want Data Science, Cloud, and Apps. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening and how Docker plays a part in the essential skills of 2020-2021 and beyond.  Articles in Series     Part 1 - Five Full-Stack Data Science Technologies   Part 2 - AWS Cloud    Part 3 - Docker (You Are Here)   Part 4 - Git Version Control   Part 5 - H2O Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)   Part 6 - R Shiny vs Tableau (3 Business Application Examples)    - The Shiny Production with AWS Book   Changing Trends in Tech Jobs  Indeed, the popular employment-related search engine, released an article this past Tuesday showing changing trends from 2015 to 2019 in \u201cTechnology-Related Job Postings\u201d. We can see a number of changes in key technologies - One that we are particularly interested in is the 4000% increase in Docker.     Source: Indeed Hiring Lab.   Drivers of Change  There are 3 Key Drivers of changes in technologies:          Rise of Machine Learning (and more generically Data Science) - Unlock Business Insights           Businesses Shifting to the Cloud Services versus On-Premise Infrastructure - Massive Cost Savings and Flexibility Increase           Businesses Shifting to Distributed Applications versus Ad-Hoc Executive Reports - Democratize Data and Improve Decision-Making within the Organization      If you aren\u2019t gaining experience in data science, cloud, and web applications, you are risking your future.  Machine Learning (Point 1)  Data Science is shifting. We already know the importance of Machine Learning. But a NEW CHANGE is happening. Organizations need distributed data science. This requires a new set of skills - Docker, Git, and Apps. (More on this in a minute).  Cloud Services (Point 2)  Last week, I released \u201cData Science with AWS\u201d. In the article, I spoke about the shift to Cloud Services and the need to learn AWS (No. 6 on Indeed\u2019s Skill Table, 418% Growth). I\u2019ll reiterate - AWS is my Number 1 skill that you must learn going into 2020.  Azure (No. 17, 1107% Growth) is in the same boat along with Google Cloud Platform for Data Scientists in Digital Marketing.  The nice thing about cloud - If you learn one, then you can quickly switch to the others.  Distributed Web Applications (Point 3) Businesses now need Apps + Cloud. I discuss this at length in this YouTube video.           Watch on YouTube      &nbsp;&nbsp;     Download the Slides     Let\u2019s talk about the BIG CHANGE from the video\u2026  The Big Change: From 2015 to 2020, apps now essential to business strategy  The landscape of Data Science is changing from reporting to application building:     In 2015 - Businesses need reports to make better decisions   In 2020 - Businesses need apps to empower better decision making at all levels of the organization   This transition is challenging the Data Scientist to learn new technologies to stay relevant\u2026  In fact, it\u2019s no longer sufficient to just know machine learning. We also need to know how to put machine learning into production as quickly as possible to meet the business needs.  To do so, we need to learn from the Programmers the basics of Software Engineering that can help in our quest to unleash data science at scale and unlock business value.  Learning from programmers  Programmers need applications to run no matter where they are deployed, which is the definition of reproducibility.  The programming community has developed amazing tools that help solve this issue of reproducibility for software applications:          Docker (and DockerHub) - Controls the software environment state           Git (and GitHub) - Controls the file state      It turns out that Data Scientists can use these tools to build apps that work.  We\u2019ll focus on Docker (and DockerHub), and we\u2019ll make a separate article for Git (and GitHub).  What is Docker?  Let\u2019s look at a (Shiny) application to see what Docker does and how it helps.    We can see that application consists of 2 things:          Files - The set of instructions for the app. For a Shiny App this includes an app.R file that contains layout instructions, server control instructions, database instructions, etc           Software - The code external to your files that your application files depend on. For a Shiny App, this is R, Shiny Server, and any libraries your app uses.      Docker \"locks down\" the Software Environment. This means your software is 100% controlled so that your application uses the same software every time.  Key terminology  Dockerfile  A Dockerfile contains the set of instructions to create a Docker Container. Here\u2019s an example from my Shiny Developer with AWS Course.    Dockerfile - Used to create a Docker Container From Shiny Developer with AWS Course  Docker Container  A docker container is a stored version of the software environment built - Think of this as a saved state that can be reproduced on any server (or computer).  Docker Containers are a productivity booster. It usually takes 30 minutes or so to build a software environment in Docker, but once built the container can be stored locally or on DockerHub. The Docker Container can then be installed in minutes on a server or computer.  Without Docker Containers, it would take 30 minutes per server/computer to build an equivalent environment.  Key Point: Docker Containers not only save the state of the software environment making apps reproducible, but they also enhance productivity for data scientists trying to meet the ever-changing business needs.  DockerHub  DockerHub is a repository for Docker Containers that have been previously built.  You can install these containers on computers or use these Containers as the base for new containers.    DockerHub - Used to share Docker Containers From Shiny Developer with AWS Course  Real Docker Use Case Example  In Shiny Developer with AWS, we use the following application architecture that uses AWS EC2 to create an Ubuntu Linux Server that hosts a Shiny App in the cloud called the Stock Analyzer.    Data Science Web Application Architecture From Shiny Developer with AWS Course  We use a Dockerfile that is based on rocker/shiny-verse:latest version.  We build on top of the \u201cshiny-verse\u201d container to increase the functionality by adding libraries:     mongolite for connecting to NoSQL databases   shiny libraries like shinyjs, shinywidgets to increase shiny functionality   shinyauthr for authentication         We then deploy our \u201cStock Analyzer\u201d application using this Docker Container called shinyauth. The application gets hosted on our Amazon AWS EC2 instance.      If you are ready to learn how to build and deploy Shiny Applications in the cloud using AWS, then I recommend my NEW 4-Course R-Track System, which includes:     Business Analysis with R (Beginner)   Data Science for Business (Advanced)   Shiny Web Applications (Intermediate)   Expert Shiny Developer with AWS (Advanced) - NEW COURSE!!         I look forward to providing you the best data science for business education.

At least not for Arya Diwase and Anushka Desai.The friends realised that education was one of the hardest-hit industries during the lockdown and that it was a time when mentorship was most required. Cashing in on this opportunity, the duo launched student mentorship Application Ally in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.Arya and Anushka who had met through Arya\u2019s not for profit organisation Jazz Hands had personal experience, applying for universities abroad previously and understood the challenges faced by students in this regard. Also, the pandemic is not particularly an easy time for students applying abroad, with a number of things to take into consideration while choosing universities.Arya, who has been working as an AIF Clinton Fellow, a competitive fellowship for social entrepreneurs, had applied to various top programs and secured admission to competitive universities like Harvard, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Duke, Berkeley, Northwestern, USC, NYU and several more since 2014.On the other hand, Anushka pursued a master\u2019s in Understanding Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse at Goldsmiths, University of London.Their own experiences in the application process led them to realise some invaluable insights develop a unique method to help fellow aspirants.\u201cI realised there is a lot of false information in the process available right now in the consultancy space. And people we have worked with also started asking for advice as they felt a slight disconnect with the existing consultancies,\u201d says Arya.The founders claim that there is a fundamental lack of integrity, personalisation, and ethics in the country's current education consulting system.\u00a0A significant reason behind this, they believe, is that consultants aren't students or have no experience of studying or living abroad.\u201cWith consolidated admits to\u00a0over 18 different international universities including\u00a0four Ivy League institutions, winning over three crores in scholarships and being acknowledged to three competitive professional fellowships, we capitalised on our diverse academic profiles\u00a0to assist guide a plethora of students with varied interests,\u201d adds Anushka.Starting upArya and Anushka had to research extensively to develop a business model. It took over two years for them in identifying a need that exists in the market and in creating a product that doesn't already exist.Once they had the business strategy in place, they personally made over 100 initial outreach calls to prospective clients, designed the website, and developed a social network marketing strategy to launch the business.Arya says the startup was launched to provide individualised assistance with the overseas college admission process. It aims to solve the problem of lack of availability of affordable quality education consulting services, while keeping integrity at the core of its work.\u00a0\u201cHowever, the application season this year is extremely competitive due to deferrals during COVID-19 and a higher number of people applying to college during a recession. Navigating that has been challenging. Additionally, colleges have updated a lot of their application requirements such as standardised testing requirements, essay prompts, etc.\u201d Anushka explains.Thus, the major task for the startup was to be more aware and stay\u00a0up-to-date on these changes for its clients.Personalised approachApplication Ally believes applications are not just about the administrative elements and requires a lot of personalisation as not everyone has the same academic or career trajectory. Thus, the startup\u2019s goal is not only to secure its clients an admission but to also help them attain a college that matches their potential, passion, and goals.For this, the founders spend time with clients, understanding their client\u2019s past journeys, requirements, financial constraints etc - based on which Application Ally allows applicants to access a pool of resources. It is primarily aimed at students looking to apply for undergraduate and graduate programs.Providing tailored assistance and verified guidance, along with school resource optimisation, Application Ally also provides counselling to individuals for extracurricular engagement support, alumni network, and interview preps, along with a series of workshops to support self-learning.\u201cApplication Ally does not believe in agency ties. We are not affiliated with colleges or third-party agencies. We believe that with college tie-ups, consultants often push clients towards colleges that may not be the right fit for them. Each client has a unique profile and requires college lists that best fit their financial, program, country and cultural requirements,\u201d says Arya.Taste of successNot having had a standard academic or professional business background, in the beginning, Anushka and Arya continually undermined their potential as entrepreneurs. They re-thought each choice of theirs and every objective set was smaller than it should have been.However, they surpassed their annual profit goal set for 2020-2021 by 300 percent within a month of launching operations.The startup\u2019s customer base comprise 60 percent of graduate students and 40 percent undergraduates. It claims to have secured over 50+ clients. Despite launching during the lockdown, the team claims to have had a 57.81 percent net profit margin over six months.Going ahead, the goal for the startup is to make the college application process more honest and student-centric rather than consultant-centric.

She hoarded anything that came from India like sweets, pickles, and ethnic clothes with care.\u00a0\u00a0For most non-resident Indians abroad, the cheapest way to get access to traditional products would be getting their friends and family back home send over the things they needed. However, Chetana believes asking for favours even from family members sometimes became a little too much. Her parents were also elderly and ailing and would find it difficult to go through the process.\u201cI really needed Indian products like pickles and I started aching for them after a while. As I started my own family later, there were things in my childhood that I thought my daughter was missing out on. It came to a point that I was embarrassed to ask for favours anymore,\u201d she says.During festivals like Diwali and Dussehra, Chetana couldn\u2019t dress up her daughter the way she wanted because ethnic clothes like lehengas would cost nearly five times the price in the UK and she was not very happy with the options available.\u00a0After returning to India in 2017, Chetana wanted to solve this problem for NRIs by starting an international package forwarding service. Registered in 2018, Forward Parcel was officially launched in 2019, a year after setting up the warehouse and website.\u00a0Chetana and her husband Rajesh Gavini who joined as a co-founder were aware of the market need as most of their Indian friends and colleagues abroad continued to face similar challenges.\u00a0How it works\u00a0After regstering on Forward Parcel\u2019s website, customers will be provided an Indian address and a phone number, which they can use to start shopping domestically.\u00a0The startup receives packages on their behalf while customers can track the status via an online dashboard. It will also send notifications with approximate weight and store all their products till the customer is done purchasing online.\u00a0\u00a0Forward Parcel then consolidates all the items in one box \u2013 remove and add packaging where needed \u2013 and delivers to their doorstep anywhere in the world within five working days.Chetana says customers save at least 70 percent on shipping by shopping through their platform instead of buying and internationally shipping products individually from each marketplace.\u00a0Once the customs paperwork is done, customers receive the final weight and shipping price, and the tracking information. Approximately, it would cost around Rs 6,000 for a package weighing 10 kg.\u00a0Challenges in the journeyAn engineering graduate from G Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Science for Women in Hyderabad, Chetana moved to the UK in 2005 to pursue a master's in multimedia communications engineering from De Montfort University in Leicester.\u00a0While Chetana is an experienced digital marketer, Rajesh brings his expertise in warehousing and operations, which has helped in managing their business. He earlier worked with Nestle in the UK and then Amazon in India.\u00a0Chetana began by reaching out to online Indian groups like \u2018Indians in London\u2019 and similar pages on social media in various countries. From there, most of the businesses are driven by word-of-mouth and references.\u00a0Many have appreciated the service once they understood the multi-step process. With more than 6,000 registered customers, Chetana claims to have 85 percent repeat customers.\u00a0The platform is also drawing interest from non-Indian population abroad with over 1,000 foreign customers registered for their service.\u00a0However, the duo says navigating their workspace and market in India was a challenge as Chetana had never worked in India before. She says being selected to the second cohort of WE HUB incubation programme has helped with access to mentorship, customer resources management, and connecting with investors who have shown interest in infusing funds.\u00a0In addition to the surge in demand amid the pandemic, the Hyderabad-based startup saw its highest sales during Diwali last month.

{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "articleBody": "+++lead-in-text\n\nWhile you're surfing the web, you ought to thank Jacob Thornton for making it so pretty.\n\n+++\n\nHe's a programmer who, along with web designer Mark Otto, created [Bootstrap](https://www.wired.com/2012/10/bootstrap-framework-plans-to-give-twitter-the-boot/), free software that the pros use to make their sites look spiffy. If you've ever noticed that a lot of websites have the same big chunky buttons, or the same clean forms, that's likely because an estimated one-fifth of all websites on the planet use Bootstrap.\n\n+++inset-left\n\n+++sidebar\n\n## Related Stories\n\n\n[#article: /articles/5f764b511e0ff1e1a9fbbda8]\n\n\n\n[#article: /articles/5db8ce323226bb000a1e5d2d]\n\n\n\n[#article: /articles/5d4229ee86c6870008b5ca92]\n\n+++\n\n+++\n\nOne reason for its spread is that Thornton and Otto made Bootstrap [open source](https://www.wired.com/tag/open-source). Anyone can use it without permission, and anyone can tweak it and improve it. Thornton didn't get a salary for making Bootstrap. When he and Otto first released it, back in 2010, they had day jobs working for Twitter. But both were propelled by classic open source motivations: It was a cool challenge, it burnished their reputations, and it felt neat to help people. Plus, watching it surge in popularity\u2014Green Day's website used it, as did Barack Obama's White House\u2014was thrilling.\n\nBut open source success, Thornton quickly found, has a dark side. He felt inundated. Countless people wrote him and Otto every week with bug reports, demands for new features, questions, praise. Thornton would finish his day job and then spend four or five hours every night frantically working on Bootstrap\u2014managing queries, writing new code. \u201cI couldn't grab dinner with someone after work,\u201d he says, because he felt like he'd be letting users down: *I shouldn't be out enjoying myself. I should be working on Bootstrap\\!*\n\n\u201cThe feeling that I had was guilt,\u201d he says. He kept at it, and nine years later he and Otto are still heading up Bootstrap, along with a small group of core contributors. But the stress has been bad enough that he often thought of bailing.\n\nWhen the open source concept emerged in the '90s, it was conceived as a bold new form of communal labor: digital barn raisings. If you made your code open source, dozens or even hundreds of programmers would chip in to improve it. Many hands would make light work. Everyone would feel ownership.\n\n+++pullquote\n\nMaking and remaking code requires high-level synthesis\u2014which, as it turns out, is hard to break into little pieces.\n\n+++\n\nNow, it's true that open source has, overall, been a wild success. Every startup, when creating its own software services or products, relies on open source software from folks like Thornton: open source web-server code, open source neural-net code. But, with the exception of some big projects\u2014like [Linux](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/linux-took-web-now-taking-world/)\u2014the labor involved isn't particularly communal. Most are like Bootstrap, where the majority of the work landed on a tiny team of people.\n\nRecently, Nadia Eghbal\u2014the head of writer experience at the email newsletter platform Substack\u2014published *[Working in Public](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862)*, a fascinating book for which she spoke to hundreds of open source coders. She pinpointed the change I'm describing here. No matter how hard the programmers worked, most \u201cstill felt underwater in some shape or form,\u201d Eghbal told me.\n\nWhy didn't the barn-raising model pan out? As Eghbal notes, it's partly that the random folks who pitch in make only very small contributions, like fixing a bug. Making and remaking code requires a lot of high-level synthesis\u2014which, as it turns out, is hard to break into little pieces. It lives best in the heads of a small number of people.\n\nYet those poor top-level coders still need to respond to the smaller contributions (to say nothing of requests for help or reams of abuse). Their burdens, Eghbal realized, felt like those of YouTubers or Instagram [influencers](https://www.wired.com/tag/influencer/) who feel overwhelmed by their ardent fan bases\u2014but without the huge, ad-based remuneration.\n\nSometimes open source coders simply walk away: *Let someone else deal with this crap.* Studies suggest that about 9.5 percent of all open source code is abandoned, and a quarter is probably close to being so. This can be dangerous: If code isn't regularly updated, it risks causing havoc if someone later relies on it. Worse, abandoned code can be hijacked for ill use. Two years ago, the pseudonymous coder right9ctrl took over a piece of open source code that was used by bitcoin firms\u2014and then rewrote it to try to steal cryptocurrency.\n\nNo one's quite sure what to do about open source burnout, but some think finding money for the coders might help. Programmer Ashley Williams is a member of the team creating the open source language Rust, and they're trying to set up a foundation to support core contributors, or get firms to keep contributors on staff. (Some of the largest open source projects thrive in precisely this fashion; firms like Facebook or Google pay some employees to work full-time on open source code.) Eghbal thinks subscriptions could offer new ways to pay for the work. Others worry that injecting pay can deform how and why the work is done in the first place.\n\nBut we need to rethink the very idea of what crowdsourcing is capable of\u2014and understand that it is perhaps more limited than promised. The open source revolution has been carried on the backs of some very weary people.\n\n***\n*If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Recently, Amazon announced PartiQL - A SQL-Compatible Query Language for their flagship NoSQL database Amazon DynamoDB. This has brought the NoSQL \u201cre:evolution\u201d full circle. It\u2019s wonderful to see the collaborative research from UCSD and Couchbase enabling the industry to move forward. NoSQL had a good run. MapReduce triggered it in 2004. Dynamo and BigTable accelerated it in 2007. NoSQL meant no support for SQL, no support for multi-document transactions, no schema management, no procedural language, and many more No\u2019s. However, NoSQL wasn\u2019t a rebel without a cause. It promised reliability, scalability, and flexibility. Someone quipped: \u201cIf you are not ready to scale, you\u2019re not ready to succeed!\u201d. To the amusement of SQL folks, MongoDB claimed it\u2019s webscale. Despite the reservations and opposition from the database community, the NoSQL movement marched on. Many wondered if it\u2019s useful for Amazon, Google, and Facebook, who else would find it useful? Here we are. With more than 200 NoSQL databases. NoSQL systems haven\u2019t remained simple key-value stores with get/set, map/reduce operations. MongoDB added an aggregation framework, a modern storage engine, and dropped ACID. DynamoDB added transactions, indexes, and now a SQL-like language. Cassandra started with CQL, an SQL-like language, made significant changes with 3.0, and has been adding new datatypes, DDLs and DMLs. Couchbase started with simple APIs, added views. In 2015, Couchbase introduced N1QL -- SQL for JSON, global secondary indexes, and later added analytical service with N1QL support, and distributed transactions. If you\u2019re read The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma, it should remind you of the Toyota and the mini mills stories. Incumbents left the low end of the market to Toyota Corona and mini mills which freed them to focus on higher margin markets. In the database industry, the Incumbents regarded NoSQL with the same derision or claimed they had SQL-less databases a long time ago! Still, there have been some half-hearted attempts by the incumbents to get into the market. Oracle even invested in NoSQL by buying Sleepycat Software, maker of the BerkeleyDB NoSQL database. IBM added JSON and MongoDB support to Informix and DB2. This is the equivalent of GM releasing the Geo Metro -- let\u2019s release a basic model at the lower end of the market and be done with it. Microsoft probably made the best attempt by building CosmosDB (formerly DocumentDB) from the ground up. NoSQL isn\u2019t simply the absence of SQL. Just like Toyota and mini mills, NoSQL has the core strengths. Toyota\u2019s strength was the single-mold frame which enabled them to produce the car in Japan, ship it 6000 miles and still be affordable for the low end of the car buyers. The single-mold frame also provided them the base to iterate and innovate to improve the car. Mini mills continue to move up the stack to produce better quality steel and the integrated steel mills usually responded by fleeing the market and avoiding competition. One fine day, GM filed bankruptcy and the integrated steel mills went out of business. So, what is the core differentiator of NoSQL? Distributed database from the core. Traditional RDBMS systems were built to run on a single machine and extended for hot-standby situations and then stretched for scale. NoSQL systems are designed to run on a cluster of machines from the get go. Hardware and software failures are expected and handled at a systemic level. In fact, COUCH in COUCHBASE stands for Cluster Of Unreliable Commodity Hardware. The core of NoSQL starts with a distributed database providing reliability and scale-out. Sure, there have been distributed database systems for 40 years. They focused on warehousing, not OLTP. NoSQL started with the measly get()/set() APIs: just enough to cover the basic use cases with shopping carts, session stores, and profile managers. There was no way that their functionality could match the sophistication of SQL. The mockery of NoSQL from the traditional database vendors is reminiscent of the response from GM and integrated steel mills. The \u201chigh priests\u201d of Oracle and IBM were happy to seed this low end market to a bunch of \u201cknow nothings.\u201d NoSQL databases have since added indexes, SQL with joins, aggregates, window functions, search and transactions. OK. This is just Couchbase. But, others have some of these. At Couchbase, we work with customers migrating off Oracle, Db2, Informix, SQL Server, and Sybase. These are great databases, but their core is different. Built for one, extended for a few. NoSQL systems are built for massive scale and reliability. Even when the higher-level index, query, and search capabilities are added, this core still has to operate at scale and be reliable. With all these capabilities, NoSQL has become the mainstay in the enterprises. Mission-critical workloads and thousands of clusters routinely run Couchbase, MongoDB, Elastic, and other NoSQL systems. NoSQL systems have made the modern database ready and affordable for modern enterprises. SQL itself has been unreasonably effective. Many NoSQL systems have been extended to support many aspects of SQL. The competition between the NoSQL systems to provide better SQL -- which means better syntax, functionality, performance, optimizer, and scale -- is fierce. As these systems grow to create an even better database, let\u2019s welcome Amazon DynamoDB to the fold and say: NoSQL is dead, long live NoSQL.

This makes sense, it\u2019s probably a natural instinct. When it comes to products and technology, a lot of people ask \u201chow are you different,\u201d but different from what? You need some sort of baseline to start from, so you can say, \u201cSimilar to X, but different because of Y.\u201d Because of this, comparisons, competitive analysis, and feature matrices are a great way to understand which technology solutions are right for you. So today let\u2019s do a comparison of three different database systems. As stated in my Database Architectures and Use Cases article: In most cases, it\u2019s not that one database is better than the other, it\u2019s that one is a better fit for a specific use case due to numerous factors. The point of this article is not to determine which database is the best, but to help uncover the factors to consider when selecting a database for your specific project. With MongoDB and PostgreSQL being two of the most popular tools out there, you may already know that there are tons of resources comparing the two. However, with HarperDB being a net new database, I thought it might be helpful to throw it in the mix to provide further clarity. Referring to my database architecture overview post again: It\u2019s important to understand things such as data type/structure, data volume, consistency, write and read frequency, hosting, cost, security, and integration constraints. That article provides a great high-level explanation across all different types of databases, but today, we\u2019ll get a but more specific. Similarities These technologies are all similar in that they are used to store data, but that simple concept is where the similarities end. However, while MongoDB and PostgreSQL are actually quite different from one another, HarperDB lies somewhere in the middle. As mentioned, there are numerous resources out there comparing MongoDB and PostgreSQL, which are both awesome databases. This article from Educative is one great place to start for understanding differences between them. Therefore, to avoid redundancy, in this post I will focus a bit more on HarperDB compared to the two. Definitions MongoDB is classified as a NoSQL database. It is document-oriented and uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. PostgreSQL is a traditional RDBMS (relational database management system). Mainly used for relational data, it is object-oriented in nature. HarperDB is a distributed database with a REST API and dynamic schema, that supports NoSQL and SQL including joins. (For example, you can ingest data via NoSQL JSON then immediately query it via SQL) Differences Overview MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a relational database handling more complex procedures, designs, and integrations. MongoDB is a NoSQL database often used for simpler, more unstructured data, great for app development. Ultimately PostgreSQL enforces schema validations whereas Mongo does not. HarperDB vs. MongoDB: MongoDB is a document store which is great for unstructured data, whereas HarperDB offers full document store capability plus enterprise grade ACID SQL. Benchmark tests found that HarperDB is 37 times faster than Mongo at less than half the price. HarperDB also has a native REST API, supports SQL on JSON, and can be easier to use and manage. See the full benchmark here.(Mongo is optimized for high scale writes, but not for reads. HarperDB's data storage algorithm written on top of LMDB enables both high scale reads and writes, resulting in high performance overall.) HarperDB v. PostgreSQL: HarperDB is more flexible than PostgreSQL, which is a great technology for complicated data or strict consistency, but HarperDB has simplified much of the work on installation, configuration, and administration. HarperDB is allowing developers from relational backgrounds to use their existing knowledge with SQL with a database that also allows their team to use NoSQL from the same data model. Accessibility MongoDB, PostgreSQL and HarperDB can each run anywhere; in the cloud, locally, data center, etc. (There is not a PostgreSQL Cloud like there is with HarperDB Cloud and MongoDB Atlas, but cloud providers offer PostgreSQL-as-a-service.) Under the hood MongoDB is mainly programmed in C, C++, and JavaScript language. PostgreSQL is mainly programmed in C. HarperDB is written in Node.js (LMDB is written in C, and Python is used in the install process). MongoDB uses BSON (binary JavaScript Object Notation) under the hood to make querying fast. This is then translated to JSON to be read when you open your collection. PostgreSQL ultimately employs SQL, a structured query language, to define, access and manipulate the database. PostgreSQL also has a JSON datatype. HarperDB does not enforce data types, it currently stores all data attributes as strings and data can be queried via SQL and/or NoSQL. (HarperDB is also working on enabling the ability for administrators to explicitly set attribute types (as numbers or strings) for performance tuning.) Data Storage and Architecture MongoDB stores data as individual documents without regard to attributes, PostgreSQL stores data in traditional tables and rows, and HarperDB stores data in tables and rows/objects with all top level attributes indexed by default. HarperDB has a unique data storage algorithm running on top of LMDB, this enables HarperDB to ingest JSON documents and relational data in a single product. As data comes in, HarperDB maps it to the data model; it's not a SQL engine or NoSQL engine. (Regardless of how data is ingested, data is stored according to the HarperDB data model and can be queried via SQL or NoSQL.) MongoDB and HarperDB are more distributed architectures, whereas PostgreSQL might be considered a monolithic architecture. ACID Properties (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable) HarperDB and PostgreSQL both have enterprise grade ACID SQL transactions, meaning the validity of data is quite reliable. NoSQL databases like MongoDB usually adopt eventual consistency instead of ACID properties. (A study from May 2020 identified a bug that disputes claims that Mongo is ACID compliant, as MongoDB\u2019s transactions are not fully isolated.) HarperDB and PostgreSQL both follow the ANSI SQL standard. Schema and Tables With both MongoDB and HarperDB, using JSON allows you to change your schema flexibly without consequence. Documents can vary in terms of key/value pairs. Both MongoDB and HarperDB scale horizontally, which allows for speed. HarperDB has bidirectional table-level data replication. HarperDB uses a simple pub-sub model; data is replicated by publishing data to different \u201cchat rooms\u201d which different nodes subscribe to and are able to be distributed horizontally. PostgreSQL scales vertically (as it gets bigger, more space or more memory is needed), therefore it requires downtime to upgrade. With relational databases like PostgreSQL, altering your table is necessary to make any changes. The whole schema needs to be designed and configured at creation. You might be able to alter a table later on, but this may lead to database downtime and bugs in your application. PostgreSQL databases can use foreign keys which explicitly link data between tables and are used to keep the data normalized. Use Cases and Summary As stated in this article, because transactions in PostgreSQL follow ACID properties, it\u2019s a good choice for industries such as fintech. When you absolutely need to control the state of your data, use a relational database like Postgres. Alternatively, if you only have unstructured data, or are working with big data, it might be a good idea to use the horizontal scaling approach with a tool like MongoDB. Use cases where HarperDB might be a better fit than existing systems include projects where you need SQL and NoSQL, rapid application development, integration, edge computing, distributed computing, real-time analytics, and high transactions. Our team will also be the first to tell you when HarperDB is not a good fit for your specific project. HarperDB is not recommended when you need full-text indexing, highly structured relational data, strict consistency across systems, or for projects where developers are not trusted to constrain and maintain data. Both MongoDB and PostgreSQL are really great tools for certain use cases. They are loved by many and the team at HarperDB is thankful that they have paved the way for technologies like ours to exist. HarperDB was created to expand and blend the capabilities of awesome SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL products on the market to fill in the gaps and ensure that developers are continuously empowered to use the right tool for the job.", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://dzone.com/articles/harperdb-vs-mongodb-vs-postgresql"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://dzone.com//dz2cdn4.dzone.com/storage/article-thumb/14177251-thumb.jpg"}}
